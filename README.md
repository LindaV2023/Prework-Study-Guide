# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide to help understand the steps involved in learning to code.  
The project was built to provide an easy to access guide and place to store rules and notes to help code.  Notes are included to give the user a place to put information that is needed and used on a regular basis. 
By doing this project we elimate the need for many pages of hand-written notes. 
From doing this assignment I learned the steps and procedures needed to begin coding.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
